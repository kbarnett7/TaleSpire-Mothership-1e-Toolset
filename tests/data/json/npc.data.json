Of course, as it spreads, the lurking worm becomes more vulnerable to exposure, which drives it to greater and greater extremes. This may simply be a mindless program, secretive for secrecy’s sake… or it may be simply the veil hiding something greater, such as an intelligence community conspiracy or a breakaway AI culture.",

Those who do are transfigured, and speak in reverent awe of communing with a consciousness whose voice is the fluttering of a million wings, whose memory predates the dust between stars, an impression of kaleidoscopic eyes and teeth, the light that will burn away the dark between the stars. Our destiny.",

Instead, the members of this “Parliament” vote on the body’s conduct through their legislative neurons. This network evolved from an organ-trafficking ring’s diagnostic system, after its AI decided that human space needed to be brought democracy and universal suffrage... down to the cellular level. A body politic can replace an organ of an unconscious captive with one of its constituents, a “slaver organ.” A heart is the most desirable choice, though the slaving takes roughly an hour to occur. A simpler method is replacing the tonsils in only five minutes, co-opting it into a type of biochemical time bomb that will release fatal botulinum and tetanus toxins in case of non-compliance.",
