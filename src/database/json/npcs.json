Of course, as it spreads, the lurking worm becomes more vulnerable to exposure, which drives it to greater and greater extremes. This may simply be a mindless program, secretive for secrecy’s sake… or it may be simply the veil hiding something greater, such as an intelligence community conspiracy or a breakaway AI culture.",

Those who do are transfigured, and speak in reverent awe of communing with a consciousness whose voice is the fluttering of a million wings, whose memory predates the dust between stars, an impression of kaleidoscopic eyes and teeth, the light that will burn away the dark between the stars. Our destiny.",

Their tails end in several long blades, coated in mind-dulling toxin. Can spit hot blood that they can track. Hate light sources. Strong light, including sunlight, causes damage to their tissues and blinds them. Attracted to moving prey, and ignore targets standing absolutely still.",
